\maketitle

% Introduction: being able to simplify or black-box circuits is helpful

% Some linear circuits and their IV plots

\begin{question}
Write an equation for the current $i$ as a function of the voltage $V$.
\end{question}


% Every linear circuit produces a single line on the IV graph
% It makes sense, then, that we could represent every linear circuit using just a slope and an offset.

% What gives us slope?
% What gives us vertical offset?
% Horizontal offset?
% Why does the resistor have to be in series/parallel?
